Clean and serene beaches give a person some peace. Long walks on those serene beaches with the sound of waves and collecting seashells sound almost perfect. Listening to the waves and getting a sunbath sound like some ideal peaceful time. An ideal beach vacation might differ from person to person. Keeping the beaches clean is also our responsibility and not just of the cleaners.</section>
